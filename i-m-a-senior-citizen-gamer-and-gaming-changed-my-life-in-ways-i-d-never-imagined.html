You, with a posse of your new best friends all over the world—about whom you know little, really, beyond their avatars—heading out to create mischief. We all chat and chuckle and celebrate on the chat channel —or commiserate as we resurrect after being 'wiped' by our opponents. &nbsp;My online friends have me aching with laughter at our antics.</p><p id=e4n-IHIx1zJ data-wc=12><strong>&nbsp;READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>I changed my entire life at 54 – here's what happened</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=egOGpP_BAKm data-wc=42>When I first started online gaming, I assumed that all gamers were young. Then, one day in our group, one player announced that she was retiring as she was turning 85 and asked if anyone want to take over running the group.</p><p id=eAHhDGK434 data-wc=79>I have spent hours online in the company of people I have never met IRL (in real life), who live all over the world. &nbsp;Some are happy to chat about their lives and circumstances, some never do – and it’s all very friendly regardless. I haven’t yet gone as far as a (real life) friend of mine who hosted a gathering of his online friend in Las Vegas. They all had a great time, by the sound of it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a045b787b1c6-gamer.jpg><p id=eWbBmE4ojixy data-wc=65>I wish I’d been there. &nbsp;It must have been fun to meet an Orc—and discover that she’s really a housewife from Kansas. &nbsp;And that her husband is a witch. &nbsp;They’d never all normally have met IRL. &nbsp;How interesting it must be to meet someone for the first time who you already know that you like and who you have done a lot of adventuring with.</p><p id=eocLddJj6ubc data-wc=77>You don’t need any special equipment to start—just your computer and a mouse. A headset comes in useful, for privacy. I wasn’t any good at first, but gradually discovered a whole new skillset. You learn quickly as you play—and it’s a nice feeling to discover that, soon enough, you are good at something wholly new and unexpected. It makes you wonder what else you can try your hand at, and gives you a new why not? attitude.</p><p id=eZoQaB2j5Dc3 data-wc=14><strong>&nbsp;READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>I went on my first solo holiday at 69 – here's what happened</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=etFckhhjnnSk data-wc=41>People’s eyes light up when they discover that you too are a gamer. Suddenly, you have so much more to talk about than the weather—and it’s less fraught than discussing politics. A moment before, you were strangers. Now, you’re fellow enthusiasts.</p><p id=euCzeNLsnVw_ data-wc=50>Gaming is an escape. You can wander around and explore lands and worlds and galaxies from the comfort of your own home. Talking of home: you can build a virtual house, or underground lair, or mountaintop castle, and furnish it how you want—and invite your friends over for a party.</p><p id=eCajiXMcsPvW data-wc=33>You never know what will happen, and what you might get up to in all those places that you could hardly imagine, but would love to explore. &nbsp;They are a richly rewarding experience.</p><p id=e1bS6ek2TV53 data-wc=70>I was in mid-game when the idea for my new book, , hit me. What would it really be like, I wondered, to be that guy? In a world like that, with its endless possibilities? A battlemage, with a magic staff that can heal my crew as well as blast out damages at our foes? Skilled, on a mission, surviving by his wits, and above all—young again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/44f524061fc9-book.jpg><p id=e0HepBLOGNCx data-wc=74>So I invented a narrator who is a retired schoolteacher, a widower, living alone in his bungalow on the edge of a small town in England, where he spends every spare moment online, gaming, where life is richer and more varied and far more exciting as his battlemage avatar than his own humdrum real life. And off we went together—not into any game, but into a strange new world that was inspired by them.</p><p id=e7lITkPUAoRm data-wc=26>Computer games have given me much more than the idea for my books.
