divorce, age, wealth, height</h1><div id=sub-header>September 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><span>Tamar Braxton is an American singer, best known for being the sister of Toni Braxton and a member of the R&B singing group The Braxtons.</span></p><p><span>Tamar, who has not found much success in a solo singing career, went on to star in her own reality television series while also becoming a TV personality.&nbsp;A former co-host of the Real talk show, she has even ventured into business, launching the Tamar collection, a ready-to-wear and footwear line.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Tamar Braxton Biography, Age</span></strong></h2><p><span>Tamar Braxton was born on Tamar Estine Braxton17.&nbsp;March 1977, the youngest of six children born to Evelyn Jackson and Micheal Conrad Braxton Sr. in Severn, Maryland, USA.&nbsp;Her father was a pastor at the local church but also worked in an electricity company, while her mother was an amateur opera singer and beautician.</span></p><p><span>Tamar and her siblings;&nbsp;Toni, Michael Jr., Traci, Towanda and Trina all grew up in a strictly religious household.&nbsp;She began singing as a toddler, following in the footsteps of her mother and sisters.&nbsp;Like her sisters, she joined the choir at her local church, where her father served.&nbsp;There, the Braxton girls gained popularity and performed together as The Braxtons.</span></p><p><span>In 1989 they were co-signed with AristaA year later they released their first single entitled “Good Life”.&nbsp;The song was a commercial failure and caused them to be dropped.&nbsp;However, it helped advance Toni’s career as an older sister.&nbsp;Tamar became a backup singer for her sister and appeared in music videos alongside her.</span></p><span>In 1996, Atlantic Records offered the group a record deal, this time without Toni and Traci.&nbsp;That year they released the album “So Many Ways” with the single of the same name.&nbsp;The album fared better than their first project together, peaking at number 26 on the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.&nbsp;A world tour with Toni Braxton, opening for them, followed before the group disbanded after Tamar decided to pursue a solo career.</span><p><span>Tamar Braxton released a self-titled album in 2000 after signing with DreamWorks Records that same year.&nbsp;The album featured production work from Missy Elliot and Jermaine Dupri but still did not receive radio play, resulting in it being dropped.&nbsp;She unsuccessfully attempted to release another album in 2004 after signing on to Casablanca Records.&nbsp;Only two singles were released to the public.</span></p><p><span>After a six-year hiatus, Tamar’s music was included on the Adidas 2: The Music Compilation.&nbsp;That same year she reunited with her sisters and mother for a reality television series on WEtv called “Braxton Family Values”.&nbsp;The success of the reality series led to a spin-off series starring her and her husband that focused on her married life and solo career.</span></p><p><span>Tamar Braxton became a bit of a StarReality TV when she started to gain a following.&nbsp;In 2013 she secured a record deal with Epic Records and officially released her second album entitled Love and War.&nbsp;The album hit shelves on September 3, 2013 and sold 114,000 copies in its first week.&nbsp;Its singles topped the charts, with the title track itself reaching #1 on the Adult R&B Songs chart, staying there for nine weeks.&nbsp;That same year, she co-hosted Fox Broadcasting Company’s talk show The Real.&nbsp;She was on the show for three years before being fired on May 22, 2016.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Tamar Braxton’s net worth is said to be around $7million.&nbsp;This number was calculated from her earnings as a television personality, singer, reality TV show actress as well as her other business ventures which includes a footwear and apparel line.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family – husband, son, divorce</span></strong></h2><p><span>Tamar Braxton has been married twice.&nbsp;Her first marriage was to music producer Darrell “Delite” Allamby.&nbsp;The marriage lasted two years.</span></p><p><span>In 2013, the same year that she divorced her husband, Tamar started seeing another music producer and record executive, Vincent Herbert.&nbsp;The couple were five years old before they exchanged vows in 2008.&nbsp;In June 2013, the couple were blessed with a son, whom they named Logan Vincent Herbert.</span></p><p><span>Recent reports have indicated that the marriage, in one particular report, Braxton may file for divorce from Herbert in October 2017, citing “irreconcilable differences.”&nbsp;However, the report has not yet been confirmed, so we have reason to believe they are still together.</span></p><h2><strong><span>More Facts About Tamar
