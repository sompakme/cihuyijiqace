of the most famous people in the entire world, and more headlines than what's fit to print, it can only be&nbsp;Kim Kardashian&nbsp;and&nbsp;Kanye West. Although Kimye is no longer together — they finalized their divorce in November 2022 — the exes and&nbsp;co-parents&nbsp;shared some milestone moments over the course of their decade-long relationship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After meeting through a mutual connection in the early 2000s, the power couple went on to date, marry, and welcome four children. Given their combined fame, their romance garnered constant media attention.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As much as Kardashian pulled at our heartstrings when she&nbsp;posted a video on Twitter&nbsp;of West's grand romantic gesture involving a Kenny G-filled Valentine's Day, it didn't distract from problems, namely West's&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>anti-semitic hate speech</a>&nbsp;and explosive rant on TMZ Live. ICYMI, we're rounding up everything you need to know about the former flames, from when they first crossed paths to their separation and every kid and rumor in between.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's a look back at Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's relationship.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2002-2003-kim-kardashian-and-kanye-west-first-meet></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2002-2003: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West first meet</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I met him, I think, in 2002 or 2003," Kardashian told Ryan Seacrest during the&nbsp;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&nbsp;10th anniversary special.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He was recording a song with Brandy, and I was her friend.

Kimmie explained that after her quickie marriage to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kris Humphries</a>&nbsp;(72 days), she flew to Paris to see West's fashion show — and that's when she fell for him.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Right before I got married to Kris Humphries, [Kanye and I] were talking, and I just went a different direction. I think I had to go through that to figure out what I wanted. After my breakup, I was feeling really low and down, and he said, 'Just come to Paris and see my fashion show,'" Kardashian told Seacrest. "He jokes that he put on this whole fashion show just to get a date with me. So, I went there, and I stayed with him, and that's where we started dating. I swear from the moment I landed, I fell madly in love with him, and I thought, 'Oh my god, why didn't I do this sooner?'

The couple was thankful, especially since the road to their second pregnancy had not been easy. The reality star&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>opened up to E!</a>, saying, "I just don't think pregnancy and me really agree with each other. You know it was really hard for me to get pregnant, so I do feel really blessed that I am pregnant, and at the end of the day, it is a million times worth it … I'm really not complaining, I'm just being honest and being honest about, I hate it you know pregnancy is not for me."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2016-kim-kardashian-and-kanye-west-go-through-a-rough-patch></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2016: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West go through a rough patch</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It proved to be a difficult year for the couple in 2016. West's Twitter rants, controversial comments, and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>reignited feud with Taylor Swift</a>&nbsp;were in full force, and Kardashian was dealing with the aftermath.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If that weren't enough, Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint during Paris Fashion Week in October, and West was later hospitalized for exhaustion in November.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Kanye and Kim had a stressful few months," a source&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>told&nbsp;People</a>.
