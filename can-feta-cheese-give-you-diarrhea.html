Symptoms usually start a half-hour to two hours after eating or drinking something with lactose. Symptoms include: Stomach cramps.<h2>Why do I poop immediately after eating?</h2>Passing stool immediately after a meal is usually the result of the gastrocolic reflex, which is a normal bodily reaction to food entering the stomach.
