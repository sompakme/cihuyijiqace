He was contacted by the Workers Force, a secret organization that experimented on humans and animals to create super soldiers. He was offered a large sum of money to participate in their project, but he refused and tried to escape. However, he was captured and injected with a serum that enhanced his physical abilities but also made him unstable and violent.</li><li>He was then forced to fight against other test subjects, including the Thing, a failed experiment that was kept in a cage. He managed to defeat the Thing, but not without sustaining severe injuries. He was then rescued by a mysterious woman, who helped him escape from the Workers Force. She also gave him a device that could control the Thing and told him to destroy it before it caused more harm.</li><li>In the present, Goo Kim arrives at the scene of the battle between the four heads and the Thing. He revealed his identity and his connection to the Workers Force, and explained the origin and purpose of the Thing. He also showed them the device that could control the Thing, and asked them to join him in destroying it. He said that the Thing was a threat to humanity and that he was the only one who could stop it.</li><li>The four heads were shocked by his revelation and wondered whether to trust him or not. Daniel asked him why he wanted to destroy the Thing, and what his motive was. Goo Kim said that he wanted to end his suffering and that he had no other choice. He also said that he had a personal grudge against the Thing and that he wanted to avenge someone. He then activated the device, and prepared to face the Thing.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_to_Read_Lookism_Chapter_479></span>Where to Read Lookism Chapter 479?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>You can read Lookism Chapter 479 online on the official website of Naver Webtoon, which is the original source of the series.
