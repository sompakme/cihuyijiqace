farewell.</p><p>"I'll do whatever it takes to be a better momma and a better woman," fallen UK soap star Danniella Westbrook posted on Instagram ahead of yet another stint in rehab in the hope of "battling her demons" once and for all.</p><p>The 43-year-old former child actor who became a star in the UK thanks to hit soap <i>EastEnders</i> announced last month she was checking herself into rehab for "all of her addictions".</p><p>It's the latest chapter in a two-decade slide which included a cocaine habit so bad her septum collapsed.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The return to rehab comes after Westbrook appeared on UK TV show <i>In Therapy</i> last year, spilling details of her history of sexual abuse, the breakdown of her relationships, and her battles to get clean.</p><p>"So I'm checking in to treatment again," she wrote in a frank social media post on March 26.</p><p>"The therapy show I did cost me a lot of heart ache, painful childhood memories & trauma that the show didn't fix.</p><p>"Put that with a total lie and sham of a marriage ... illness ... and a break up from the only man I ever loved and losing a baby last year, I think it's time I did this once and for all for myself my kids and my very small but close circle of friends."</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with

Yes. But I do want a quality of life I don't have today and the freedom of a life without demons haunting me and making me weak to my addictions.</p><p>"So in a few weeks time I shall be checking in to a treatment centre and I won't be leaving until I'm 100% well in my mind body and (love)."</p><p>It's the latest public declaration in the very public fall of a child star who had the world at her feet, until fame and addiction combined to derail it.</p><h2 class=article__heading>How it came to this</h2><p>Danniella Westbrook was the teenager with the celebrity world at her feet. Plucked from obscurity at the age of 16 to join the cast of BBC soap <i>EastEnders</i>, she always wanted to be famous.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-entertainment">Related articles</h2><p>She got her wish as feisty, flirty, manipulative teen Samantha Mitchell in the soap in her first stint on the show, from 1990 to 1993, when she quit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/3gglGSm7L3l3RNlzBClv-LXR-Mk=/16x24/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/GEI7FKTAZDKEIBIMKCZ2Y2SO5M.jpg"><p>By then she was in the grip of a drug that would make her infamous.</p><p><i>EastEnders</i> asked her back in 1995, but by 1996, they were forced to write her out as her cocaine addiction took hold.</p><p>In 1999, they gambled on her again. By then, the addiction had eroded her nasal septum, and she was reportedly filmed from certain angles to keep it from view.</p><p>But by 2000 producers had had enough as the cocaine binges continued, and showed her the door again.</p><p>In May 2000, an image of her showing her missing septum was given to newspapers, and the badly-kept secret of excessive drug abuse was out.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>So began her first stint of rehab.

By the time she joined <i>EastEnders,</i> she was a regular on the club scene, admitting she was wooed by what she thought was the 'glamour' of it.</p><p>At the hight of her addiction, she was doing five grams a day, and it's estimated she blew more than A$415,000 on her habit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/DHxmIKgc_MC7aK61Dw3dt7NNWyE=/16x24/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/WTIHOB4PKUBKH4P7NIMMWTT6XM.jpg"><p>The habit was so bad, it rotted away her septum, the cartilage that divides the nostrils.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Effectively, her nose had collapsed. Her relationships did too.</p><p>Surgery rebuilt her nose. Rebuilding her life was harder.</p><p>In 2000 she quit drugs amid warnings from doctors that her A$650 a day habit would kill her. But the addiction would keep calling her back.</p><p>She claims she was clean for 12 years, but addiction and depression were evil co-conspirators who were never far away. She attempted suicide more than a dozen times. She and the doctors would paper over the cracks, and she'd try to rebuild it all again.</p><p>After undergoing treatment for addiction, Westbrook got married and had two children.</p><p>But she soon relapsed, and released two autobiographies about her journey, <i>The Other Side of Nowhere</i> in 2006, and <i>Faith, Hope and Clarity</i> in 2013.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><h2 class=article__heading>"I did cocaine giving birth"</h2><p>Westbrook's oldest son Kai is now 20.</p><p>His dad is Robert Fernandez, Westbrook's partner for three years until 1998.</p><p>Kai was brought into the world in 1996, by a drug addict who loved cocaine so much, she even snorted it while in labour, she revealed in a tearful confession to TV host Jeremy Kyle in 2012.</p><p>Admitting to a five grams of cocaine a day habit while pregnant, Westbrook revealed she did lines of it while in labour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/u7S0P5qxIGPGHKPyOhMATA7eu04=/16x25/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/H4YBWJAJTR3APIMNQ6SFUTSKXM.jpg"><p>Ten minutes after her firstborn entered the world, she snuck into a bathroom for another snort.</p><p>Four years later, Kai found her half dead from a cocaine overdose.
