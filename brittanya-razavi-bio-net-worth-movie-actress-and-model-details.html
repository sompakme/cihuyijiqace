Actress and Model Details</h1><div id=sub-header>August 2024 · 3 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><span>She is known as an American actress, model and entrepreneur these days, but it all started for Brittanya Razavi on the place where dreams are made, Instagram.&nbsp;It might be flashy imagery and greener pastures for the social media sensation now, but her story is a classic, starting from the bottom.&nbsp;There are so many indications that she is not your average social media star.&nbsp;To back that up, here’s a much-needed glimpse into her life.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Brittanya Rasavi’s Biography</span></strong></h2><p><span>The social media sensation was born on July 7, 1985 in Oxnard, California as Brittanya O-Campo.&nbsp;There is not much information about her childhood and upbringing.&nbsp;Nonetheless, the fact that it was anything but peachy may help.&nbsp;Brittanya Razavi grew up with four siblings and by the time she was 15 her father was out of the picture.&nbsp;He was sent to prison and as such she had to grow up without male guidance.&nbsp;It is speculated that this was a focal point for the internet sensation.</span></p><p><span>Although she was the last child, she had to grow up a bit faster to run the household.&nbsp;She may have grown a bit too tall because the year her father was incarcerated was the year she became pregnant.&nbsp;Her grandfather had little or no means to take care of her child and helped raise her.&nbsp;The identities of her grandfather and her son are not known to this day.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Brittanya Razavi Net Worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>There is no doubt that Brittanya Razavi is a hard working woman.&nbsp;Her hard work paid off and made her an incredibly wealthy woman.&nbsp;As of 2018, Forbes confirmed that she was worth a whopping $6 million, with other sources offering around $8 million.</span></p><p><span>Not bad for a social media star, right?&nbsp;Well, Brittanya is much more than that. After gaining popularity on social media, she made the switch to reality television in 2009.&nbsp;She appeared in the reality television series.&nbsp;</span><span>Rock of Love</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Charm School</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;Although she displayed a fiery temper and wasn’t a winner on those shows, they catapulted her to the next level.&nbsp;Soon after, she was featured in a number of popular magazines.&nbsp;Brittanya Razavi has graced the cover of&nbsp;</span><span>Wilde Tattoo</span><span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;</span><span>Tattoo Energy, Formerly&nbsp;</span><span>Spire Magazine</span><span>&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;</span><span>MMA Sports</span><span>&nbsp;.</span></p><span>The culmination of her career is her online clothing store.&nbsp;</span><span>187</span><span>&nbsp;Ave.</span><h2><strong><span>Facts about the film actress and model</span></strong></h2><h3><strong><span>She is a family woman</span></strong></h3><p><span>Although it was common knowledge that she was in the past, this relationship went down the drain.&nbsp;Brittanya Razavi suggested that this was due to verbal abuse, among other things.&nbsp;Despite this, she moved on and is currently married to Lucky Moe Razavi.&nbsp;Her husband is of Iranian descent and the couple have two sons together.&nbsp;The two definitely have common interests considering they are both covered in tattoos.&nbsp;All in all, it seems like a perfect match.</span></p><p><span>Bretagne’s husband is also quite successful.&nbsp;He is an entrepreneur and managing director of a digital media and entertainment group.</span></p><h3><strong><span>She is a female all-rounder</span></strong></h3><p><span>She may be widely known as a social media star, but Brittanya Razavi has a handful of tricks up her sleeve.&nbsp;Aside from her brief but rewarding stint in reality TV, she embarked on an even more rewarding career as a model.&nbsp;She is also a co-owner of&nbsp;</span><span>187 Avenue</span><span>&nbsp;which is an online clothing and merchandise store.&nbsp;Razavi also co-authored a book titled&nbsp;</span><span>Millionaire Soliloquy</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;Right now it should be clearer just how hardworking she is.&nbsp;Additionally, she starred as Lexus on the comedy show&nbsp;</span><span>Dysfunctional Friends</span><span>&nbsp;.</span></p><p><span>See also: Alexis DeJoria – Bio, Father, Age, Net worth, Jesse James Wife</span></p><h3><strong><span>She spent 6 months in prison</span></strong></h3><p><span>As shown live on reality TV, the star is in quite a mood.&nbsp;In a fit of anger, she attacked a woman with a drinking cup and the result was a 6-month prison sentence.&nbsp;Apparently, she dumped the victim so much that she needed stitches afterwards.&nbsp;Since then, she has endeavored to make amends by walking the straight and narrow road now.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiaop7Bta3NsphmqpGvrre1jJugqGWemsFuw86rq6FlnaTDqrGMmpqtqpWowG6tzZ1kpqeUmrlusMStmKKko2Q%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./g-herbo-net-worth-2024.html>&#171;&nbsp;G Herbo Net Worth 2024</a>
