We're pretty sure they served up the greatest steaks in London alongside some of the most delicious sides you've ever tried (yes, you'll want to order them all) - but if that's not to your tastebuds, the saffron risotto with oxtail and bone marrow will blow your mind. Make sure you sample some sushi too, and definitely save room for pudding - or convince someone to share - so you can order the Baked Alaska. Although situated on the busy Park Lane, the outdoor terrace is tucked away and surrounded by plants, so whether you wash your dinner down with champagne or cocktails (go for a Negroni), we promise it will be intimate and delicious.</p><p id=ezss8kgdi0TS data-wc=1></p><h3>The Ivy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/51cb5f80b352-the-ivy-kensington-brasserie-outdoors-z.jpg><p id=ecU9CaN0Ql1O data-wc=65>The Ivy Soho Brasserie and The Ivy Kensington Brasserie will be re-opening their beautiful, heated and covered terraces for outdoor dining. Situated in the heart of Kensington and Soho, guests can enjoy wine, cocktails, and Ivy classic dishes such as chicken Milanese, shepherd’s pie and the ever so indulgent chocolate bombe. If you want to book something with the 'wow' factor, these are for you!</p><p id=e97Y4os-Z1gS data-wc=12></p><p id=eDZhoIwpMPc1 data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>9 celebrities enjoying idyllic UK staycations</a></p><h3>Solas Terrace at The Savoy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2a44e20de1b5-solas-z.jpg><p id=e8QMrEmlSyyZ data-wc=82>Attention seafood lovers. The iconic Savoy Hotel in central London has transformed its grand entrance into a pop-up seafood restaurant and bar – and it looks simply stunning. The Savoy Solas Terrace, in partnership with Bowmore Whisky, hopes to transport guests back to the roaring twenties with its shimmering chandelier, suspended crystal decoration and joie de vivre vibes. The showstopping venue&nbsp;was designed by creative experimentalist Meredith O'Shaughnessy, who worked to create a speakeasy-style lounge that "oozes with opulence, elegance and style".</p><p id=eVuRGi6Goi_u data-wc=79>The pop-up will serve the freshest, responsibly sourced seafood including oysters, scallops, lobster, langoustines, caviar, Dorset crab and Scottish salmon to name a few. There's also an exceptional cocktail menu with a big focus on Bowmore scotch whisky; Solas aptly means light, joy and comfort in Gaelic. The restaurant is open seven days a week&nbsp;but pre-booking is highly recommended. So what are you waiting for? Seafood and champagne – sounds like the perfect way to celebrate lockdown easing.</p><p id=egnY-klHP3IQ data-wc=5></p><h3>The Wigmore Summer Terrace and Garden</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/578acec8690a-the-wigmore-z.jpg><p id=e0XWGK4D_AXZ data-wc=147>If you're looking for somewhere to reset and relax after a day of post-lockdown shopping on Oxford Street, the outdoor restaurant at The Langham is just the spot. Possibly one of the prettiest alfresco venues in central London, the Wigmore Summer Terrace and Garden is a new set-up for this year and takes over the five-star hotel's courtyard garden area. With a fully covered pergola on one side, and tables dotted under a canopy of trees in the rest of the 75-capacity dining space, not to mention the reams of fairy lights and hanging flower baskets, it really is the most idyllic spot to while away an afternoon. You'll immediately be transported away from the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street and Regent Street, and there's no need to worry about rain or the cold weather as the venue has an abundance of heaters and covered tables.</p><p id=e7MLN6AVrmYp data-wc=113>The food menu is inspired by the hotel's pub The Wigmore, so expect everyone's favourites like the cheeseburger and ham hock pie, or the smoked chicken croquetas and the innovative and unbeatable Masala spiced scotch egg. If you're after something more substantial and really want to treat yourself, go for the mouthwatering Buccleuch beef rib eye, which is served with peppercorn sauce and perhaps unconventionally, mozzarella sticks. The drinks list is even more extensive and features a plethora of gin-based mixers as well as summery cocktails. The Russian Spring Punch will suit those with a sweet tooth, but you can't beat a Froze to really get you in the summery alfresco dining mood.</p><p id=eZeLYRHvWNQx data-wc=4></p><h3>Bisushima</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/986b95caf88a-bisushima-z.jpg><p id=eHzxrENRDNV7 data-wc=67>Take your alfresco dining experience to new heights, quite literally, at Bisushima in central London. Overlooking Trafalgar Square and the perfect spot to watch the sun set against the city's skyline, this authentic Japanese restaurant has two outdoor terraces that wrap around the main indoor space. It's a fancy but not pretentious venue, and the ideal choice for a cosy date night or to celebrate something special.</p><p id=e3JmkyGsfmM- data-wc=126>You'll really be treating yourself to the finest and freshest fish and seafood, with the menu boasting classics like lobster tempura and sauteed scallops and a never-ending list of sashimi and nigiri. The standout dishes were, however, the toro carpaccio made up of the most exquisite dry-aged toro sashimi, and the more unexpected grilled lamb cutlets you wouldn't normally see on a Japanese menu. Splash out on some fresh oysters to start or smoked salmon with tofu puree, and make sure you save space for their delectable desserts, which are heavy on the yuzu and matcha. We can attest that even dining in the pouring rain didn't dampen our spirits as the staff very helpfully provide blankets and the tables are covered and flanked by heaters.</p><p id=e-d2zYRw1dbM data-wc=4></p><h3>The Tapas Room</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/345564286f8a-tapas-room-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e5gDOAgrU3yC data-wc=3>© Frank Payne</p><p id=e4nBdiNme2nC data-wc=53>Not technically outdoors but still allowed to open by law, Brixton Village is teaming with multi-cultural restaurants and the permanent roof makes it perfect for when you can't rely on the British weather for your alfresco catch-ups. The Tapas Room is by far your best bet if you're in the mood for tapas.</p><p id=eqr17CHhAIGD data-wc=100>It specialises in traditional Spanish fare, such as salt cod croquettas, pan con tomate and Padron peppers (all of which were excellent), but also surprises with some of its more modern and equally sublime dishes. Among the showstoppers are the duck breast served with pickled pear and hazelnut, and the cider braised pork belly glazed with membrillo and sherry. There is also a wide selection of cheese and cured meats if you fancy a charcuterie sharing board. On weekends, diners can take advantage of their new brunch menu which includes inventive dishes like octopus crumpet and broken eggs with morcilla.</p><p id=eH9XMyoE-Saf data-wc=62>And as for the wine list, it wouldn't be tapas night without a tipple or two and the restaurant's list carries on for pages and pages. From cava to sherry to orange wine and sweet dessert wine, you're spoilt for choice. Delectable sharing dishes, a relaxed yet buzzy atmosphere, and friendly and helpful staff – The Tapas Room ticks all the boxes.</p><p id=eDXWD64HL_iz data-wc=4></p><h3>Café Biltmore</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ff5d2e3a75f0-cafe-biltmore-z.jpg><p id=e2fX61hpX1lj data-wc=188>Tucked away at the back of Mayfair-based The Biltmore hotel is Café Biltmore Restaurant and Terrace. Fans of Jason Atherton will be pleased to hear that the Michelin-starred chef has created a new, relaxed menu that puts a modern twist on some classic dishes. Think beef burgers, steaks, buttermilk fried chicken and crowd-pleasing pizzas and pastas. But for lighter options, the grilled Cornish plaice is an absolute delight and goes splendidly with fine beans and confit shallot. There's also a peach-adorned summer salad or an English pea risotto for vegetarian mains, while the cured Loch Duart salmon starter, drizzled with a ponzu dressing, coriander, chilli and lime is a refreshing way to start your meal. Finish off with a decadent Valrhona chocolate moelleux which comes with a dollop of milk ice cream, or a cheeseboard of British and European cheese if you don't have much of a sweet tooth. A pleasant and relaxed place to dine in the heart of Mayfair, the one drawback of this terrace is the lack of covering for all tables, so you might find yourself having to dash indoors if the heavens open!</p><p id=eiNP-DnWLlcK data-wc=5></p><h3>Mezcalito</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/083db67f2151-tulum-terrace-z.jpg><p id=eVlNNcboNWer data-wc=179>Bringing the taste and sounds of Mexico to the heart of Chelsea, buzzy restaurant and bar Mezcalito is the perfect place to while away a boozy brunch (every Saturday and Sunday) or let your hair down at an evening fiesta. With its 'Tulum Terrace' – a covered, comfy outdoor seating area where guests are encouraged to don a sombrero and embrace the beach vibes – it's the ideal venue to raise spirits for those of us enjoying a, shall we say, less-than-tropical British summer. The menu has everything you would expect – tasty tacos (we particularly loved the pulled pork carnitas), nachos, burritos, quesadillas (try the camaron al ajillo)… and for dessert don't miss the churros rellenos – chocolate filled churros dusted with icing sugar. Delicious. And what's a Mexican meal without a margarita? There are muchos on the menu, including the passion fruit option, served in a day of the dead-inspired glass – a Mexican twist on the popular Porn Star Martini. Our verdict? This place is a slice of beachy heaven in the city. Don't miss it!</p><p id=e_Zg2MB-6oqx data-wc=5></p><h3>The&nbsp;Botanist&nbsp;Sloane Square</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/571c29366f4e-pizza-on-the-sqaure-z.jpg><p id=eGYpG-7RJcQ0 data-wc=71>Shopping on the King's Road? Then make sure you pop down to The Botanist on Sloane Square for 'Pizza On The Square'. This is an amazing new alfresco dining offering, based in the heart of Chelsea. The new summer pop-up, running in partnership with Casamigos, features a beautiful solid oak bar offset by traditional rattan furnishings and surrounded by palms and foliage to make the ideal setting for lazy summer nights.</p><p id=e3eiXHLqTuel data-wc=59>Here guests will enjoy the new pizza concept with a newly crafted menu offering authentic, wood-fired pizzas including: Garlic and Mushroom White Pizza, parmesan cream, Buffalo mozzarella, garlic mushrooms, walnuts and truffle oil; &nbsp;Pepperoni pizza with buffalo mozzarella and caramelised onions and the vegetarian Caponata pizza, aubergine, peppers, capers, black olives and buffalo mozzarella to name but a few.&nbsp;</p><p id=eYi8Ir45ZFvJ data-wc=30>The alfresco menu also caters for those wanting something a little lighter with a Butternut squash and Caesar Salad options all served alongside refreshing tequila cocktails, draft beers and Champagne.</p><p id=exD0s_wQ-ey_ data-wc=2></p><h3>Mr Fogg's Secret Garden</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/155b2add8aab-mr-foggs-secret-garden-z.jpg><p id=ecsJ0SQ5-75v data-wc=88>Tucked away down a lane in Mayfair lies Mr Fogg's Secret Garden, which really is easy to miss if you didn't know it was there. The charming alfresco terrace, which is decked out with pretty foliage, artificial grass and rustic wheelbarrows, is fully covered so it's a good spot if you need a break from the British heatwave. The bar's signature cocktails are the showstoppers of the menu, with The Constant Gardener being a firm favourite, while there's also a good selection of long drinks, champagne and wine.</p><p id=eLbGciv9WJ67 data-wc=4></p><h3>Coqbull Soho</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1349346d06fd-coqubull-z.jpg><p id=e9UVpmPMwo3e data-wc=149>You wouldn't know it was there unless you'd heard about it or visited before, but Coqbull Soho, located just off Picadilly Circus, takes casual dining to new heights with its secluded rooftop terrace. It's a great alfresco spot to dine in if you're looking for somewhere central, with the focus being on free-range rotisserie chicken and gourmet beef burgers. Think cheesy nachos, popcorn chicken, dirty loaded fries, southern fried chicken on waffles and a variety of chicken and beef burgers. There are, of course, veggie and healthier dishes, but this joint is all about getting your hands messy and feasting on good old comfort food. Wash it all down with some indulgent milkshakes and a cheeky 'coqtail' or two. The chain, which also serves up an appetising brunch menu, has just opened its expansive outdoor terrace at its Spitalfields Market branch if you're looking for a restaurant east side.</p><p id=eGMNUfe6_0P3 data-wc=5></p><h3>Frenchie</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/388471a8228e-frenchie-z.jpg><p id=eBF8S8uE8T1Y data-wc=153>Like many establishments, Covent Garden's chicest restaurant Frenchie opened an outdoor dining area this year amid the pandemic. It's welcomed guests to its small but buzzy terrace since May, so why not check out the new area and while you're at it, celebrate Frenchie's belated fifth birthday in style. The modern French restaurant has created an exquisite six-course tasting menu showing off the crème de la crème of Frenchie's dishes. Highlights include the melt-in-your-mouth bacon scone and the seemingly understated Cornish turbot, which has a beautiful smoked flavour and is bathed in a crab bisque. The duck breast is another dish of beauty, while the banoffee is not what you'd expect. A restaurant bestseller, it's a deconstructed dessert made up of banana sorbet cocooned in a light and fluffy chocolate mousse. The £70 tasting menu, which can be tailored for vegetarians, also comes with a wine pairing, which is never a bad idea!</p><p id=e6VZ785npuFK data-wc=5></p><h3>The Distillery Bankside</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/408945c89df4-distillery-bankside-outdoors-z.jpg><p id=eNYy0oZq2Xt- data-wc=77>Need a treat for the senses? The Distillery Bankside is located on the site of Stevenson & Howell’s Fragrance Factory, which distilled essential oils and manufactured essences, flavourings&nbsp;and garnishes during the 1800s. The bar pays homage to its heritage by serving signature cocktails using home-made syrups, aromatics, infusions and bitters, all hand-crafted by their expert bartenders. Gin lovers can choose from 100 different varieties - so you'll definitely want to head back to tick them off...</p><p id=eBJVhg0qhW9S data-wc=2></p><h3>The Hawk's Nest</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e0f6011b19b0-hawks-nest-z.jpg><p id=etiFvO63WhoB data-wc=70>A hidden gem in this bustling west London area, blink and you'll miss the entrance to The Hawk's Nest. Two guys with a whole lot of vision transformed an abandoned railway arch into a secret oasis. The divine cocktails and perfect pizzas will impress you and the buzzy atmosphere will keep you coming back for more. The sourdough pizzas are unreal, but&nbsp;do make sure you save room for gelato!</p><p id=eH4pkqu1fJum data-wc=2>&nbsp;</p><h3>Lost in Brixton</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0d0f86c8c184-lost-in-brixton-z.jpg><p id=eHwHrSPJ4OEm data-wc=73>Nothing screams summer like Lost in Brixton, a garden oasis in the heart of&nbsp;bustling Brixton Village. The venue, which is decked out with hanging foliage and wooden tables, serves food from the village itself, including from Fish, Wings & Tings, Jalisco Brixton, Okan, and The Joint. Sip on Latin American-inspired cocktails and Brixton craft beers as you enjoy live music from local talent and&nbsp;DJs providing the party atmosphere all summer long.</p><p id=eDZuQVgy3Iz4 data-wc=5><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>lostinbrixton.com</a></p><h3>Cocotte</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8b418fb86f8b-cocotte-new-z.jpg><p id=eraN1HUr0WC8 data-wc=161>Winner winner, chicken dinner. There's nothing more comforting than tucking in to a roast chicken and for those who haven't made it down to one of Cocotte's four London restaurants, you need to book a table stat. Known for serving up some of the best rotisserie chicken outside of France, our meal at the Shoreditch terrace&nbsp;did not disappoint. The free-range chicken, which is marinated overnight in herbes de Provence and various spices, is a definitive crowd-pleaser from the crispy golden skin to the succulent and tender meat. As much thought is put into the chicken as the sides, which include roasted root veggies and creamy mash. But the absolute signature dish that you have to accompany your main with is the truffled mac and cheese. Pure indulgence. There's also a brunch menu on weekends, and we can hand on heart say the sweet chilli chicken thighs (oh so juicy) on freshly baked croissant waffles were the best we've ever had.</p><p id=eAJ1LMX7WwXl data-wc=6></p><h3>14 Hills&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9bd525356e95-14-hilld-z.jpg><p id=egNqFQYWn_EG data-wc=59>14 Hills has an alfresco terrace perfect for some outdoor outings! With a spectacular view of London's skyline, the terrace will be open from morning till midnight - so get up there for some drinks and dinner in the sunshine!
