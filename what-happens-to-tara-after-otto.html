Tara doesn't want the boys to have any contact with SAMCRO, and this includes any contact with Jax. They may have had their ups and downs, but to keep him from seeing his children is a bit much.<h2>How does Otto betray the club?</h2>He was quite an intelligent man, often reading books in prison. His one weakness however was his wife Luann who he asked the club to look after as his only favor. After she was killed, he ratted on the club for failing to look after her but later regretted turning and sought to make it right.<h2>Does Tara have an abortion with Jax baby?</h2>While in Chicago, Tara dated ATF agent Joshua Kohn, and got pregnant by him, but had an abortion at six weeks.

After a rift between Tara and Jax and the murder of Donna Winston, Jax and Wendy reconciled and were seen making love.<h2>Do Clay and Gemma get back together?</h2>Gemma's family is the most important thing in the world to her, so the thought of living without Jax or her grandsons is too much to bear. Because of this, she agrees to get back together with Clay.<h2>Was Jax ever a prospect?</h2>For the first time ever, see the full, authorized story of Jax Teller's first year as a SAMCRO prospect — a year that may ask more of him than he's prepared to give. The ride begins here. Jax Teller has always had one dream: to follow the family legacy and join the Sons of Anarchy.<h2>Why does Tara visit Otto?</h2>Tara's big heart got her into big trouble on the latest chapter of "Sons of Anarchy." She'd been making nice with Otto in prison to convince him to retract his testimony in a legal case hanging over the Sons. She brought him his old lady's perfume and even shared in a powerful emotional breakdown with the felon.<h2>Why did Juice betray Jax?</h2>So, behind Nero's back, he ordered Juice to smother Darvany to death with a pillow. Once an wacked-out Juice relayed that information to Nero, he betrayed Jax (he also, obviously, created a lot of tension between Nero and Jax, which will no doubt play out in the coming episodes). And that's why Jax wants to kill Juice.<h2>Is Otto a girl re Zero?</h2>He also appears in various related works, including side stories, short stories and video games all based in the narrative universe of Re:Zero. Otto Suwen was a young man active in the Kingdom of Lugunica whose lineage consisted of many merchants. Otto himself was a merchant, although he wasn't especially successful.<h2>Does Jax find out Tara didn't rat?</h2>Gemma is sitting on the floor next to Tara's body saying, “It had to be done.” Eli tells Gemma that Tara didn't rat — Jax volunteered to turn himself in to keep her safe. Before Eli can call in the murder, Juice shoots him in the back. When Jax arrives home, he finds the bloody bodies of Tara and Eli.<h2>Who does Jax cheat on Tara with?</h2>Spoiler alert: Sons of Anarchy's season 6 premiere featured many scenes that got fans talking, one of which was Jax (Charlie Hunnam) cheating on his wife Tara (Maggie Siff) with maternal madame Colette (Kim Dickens), someone with whom he's also jumping into business.<h2>Was Tara pregnant season 6?</h2>Alanna Masterson, who plays Tara on "The Walking Dead," filmed much of season six while pregnant. During Saturday's panel for the series at New York Comic Con, Masterson went into detail to describe the challenges of filming while pregnant, noting that she was on set until she was about two weeks away from delivery.<h2>Does Tara fake a pregnancy?</h2>Last week, Jax (Charlie Hunnam) learned that Tara (Maggie Siff) faked her pregnancy — and a miscarriage — as part of an elaborate scheme to keep Gemma (Katey Sagal) from being able to gain custody of Jax and Tara's sons should Tara end up in jail for the charges pending against her.<h2>Why was SOA Cancelled?</h2>Sutter noted he was aware that the costs of making a TV show began to exceed the profit value of a show after seven seasons, so it's possible that that's what Sutter had in mind from the beginning, and so he carefully planned Jax's story in a way that it could be fully told in seven seasons.<h2>Who kills Juice in SOA?</h2>Instead, Juice approaches Tully in the cafeteria and tells him everything before giving him a scalpel. He merely asks "Just let me finish my pie." Tully's men then distract the guards, allowing Tully to stab Juice in the neck with the scalpel. Juice bleeds out and dies.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lmJa9sbHNrGStp12prrOtjJqdrZ2iYry1wM4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./why-did-sam-and-colby-go-to-jail.html>&#171;&nbsp;Why Did Sam And Colby Go To Jail?</a>
