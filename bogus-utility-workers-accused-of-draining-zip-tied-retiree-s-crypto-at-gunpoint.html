To open the account, Castro provided Coinbase with an image of the front and back of his driver’s license, his phone number, his email, and his home address, the affidavit states. That afternoon, a Coinbase account was also established in St. Felix’s name with all of his personal info, as well. The next day it, too, received a crypto deposit of more than $22,000.
