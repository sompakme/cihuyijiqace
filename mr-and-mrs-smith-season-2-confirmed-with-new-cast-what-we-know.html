Created by <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/donald-glover-community-movie/>Donald Glover</a> and Francesca Sloane, the comedic spy-thriller is a reimagined version of the 2005 action movie starring <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/angelina-jolie/>Angelina Jolie</a> and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/brad-pitt/>Brad Pitt</a>. This time, instead of working for competing agencies, John (Glover) and Jane (<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/maya-erskine-interview-2024/>Maya Erskine</a>) are strangers partnered in an arranged spy marriage under a mysterious entity. They must complete missions together and balance their burgeoning relationship with the demands of their handler. The series puts a more relatable spin on the sexy spy thriller, showing the minutiae, squabbles, and injuries behind glamorous covert activities. And if Erskine and Glover's impressive performances weren't enough, season 1 also included a laundry list of fun guest stars, including Paul Dano, Parker Posey, Sarah Paulson, and Michaela Coel.</p><p>All eight Mr. and Mrs. Smith episodes were released on Prime Video at once, which was both good news and bad news for anyone prone to devouring a delightful watch and immediately regretting that once it's over. Thankfully, Sloane and Glover have ideas for where things could go after that head-scratching cliffhanger. Below, find a breakdown of everything we know about Mr. and Mrs. Smith season 2.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EhL6fTPrGqzZQep7zMkZPB-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=what-happened-in-the-39-mr-and-mrs-smith-39-season-1-finale-3>What happened in the 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' season 1 finale?</h2><p>By the final episode of the eight-episode debut season, John and Jane's relationship has completely dissolved due to the pressures of their job and their different visions of the future. (John would be okay with a safer career and kids, while Jane, and their handler "Hi hi" think she's ready for more dangerous missions.)</p><p>As the episode starts, they've failed their third mission and broken up following John's emotional affair with a mark (Michaela Coel). Jane wakes up alone and receives a message from "Hi hi" telling her to terminate John. Soon after, a sniper shoots into the brownstone, missing her but killing her cat. Whether or not John was the shooter is unclear, but it starts Jane on a murder mission. When John discovers that a bomb has been planted at his mother Denise's house, it's game on. (Fun fact: His mom is played by Glover's actual mom, Beverly!)</p><p>The exes meet at the Whitney Museum for a brief, tense conversation before it devolves into deadly fighting, from Jane trapping John in an explosive revolving door to the pair chasing each other through the streets of downtown NYC. Jane gets to the brownstone first and locks John out, but she discovers that his mom Denise is already there. (She also learns that his real, non-spy name is Michael.) Jane and Denise have a heart-to-heart, while John plays buddy-buddy with their hot neighbor (Paul Dano), so he can go through the next-door brownstone and sneak up on Jane. At that moment, John discovers their neighbor has been spying on him and Jane, but he's not secretly "Hi hi." He's just a civilian, and Sotheby's just really wants the Smith's house.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zi3YAMpHGbJaq8KYFjCHdL-1920-80.jpg><p>In a more direct homage to the 2005 movie, John and Jane shoot up their gorgeous house while trying to take each other down. After the fight sequence, John subdues and ties Jane up long enough to dose the both of them with the "truth serum" they used earlier in the season (who could forget the John Turturro dog roleplay episode).</p><p>While drugged, Jane reveals she previously tested for sociopathic tendencies and kept a jar-of-marbles tracker for whenever she exhibited that behavior (78 so far). John says he feels his asthma makes him less of a man. Jane says she likes John's jealousy and admits lying about sleeping with two targets on a mission, just to hurt him, as his flirtation with Bev hurt her. They confess their feelings for each other, and that they couldn't bring themselves to take the fatal shots.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Sign up here.</p><p>The two also realize they weren't the ones who fired the first shots at each other, and a pair of old friends stop by. Their friends and fellow spies played by Wagner Moura and Parker Posey arrive and turn out to be “finalizers," or Smiths who kill whichever Smiths the company wants to get rid of. (Assumedly, they took out the Smiths, played by Alexander Skarsgård and Eisa González, in the season premiere.) Glover John and Erskine Jane fight valiantly to survive, but John is eventually shot in the abdomen. Jane rushes him to their safe room and locks them inside, where they discuss their future. With John's life in peril, she finally tells him her real name is Alana and they decide to face the other Smiths. Jane opens the door with just one bullet left in her gun's chamber. Then, the camera cuts to outside their apartment. We hear three shots ring out, but it's not clear who lives and who dies.</p><p>In the final mid-credits scene, their neighbor enters their house the next morning, under the guise of dropping off a book. He peeks through the open door, riddled with bullet holes, and calls out to the empty house while surveying the mess. Walking back out of the house and down the street, he puts in a phone call to his boss and says, "I think they might be ready to sell.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SbHj8qRahQL78VTWHksuZB-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=has-39-mr-and-mrs-smith-39-been-renewed-for-season-2-3>Has 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' been renewed for season 2?</h2><p>Mr. and Mrs. Smith season 2 is officially happening! On May 14, 2024, Prime Video revealed that the thriller would return for a second installment, with co-creator Sloane also returning as showrunner.</p><p>Even before the announcement, the series was likely to continue in some form. It received rave reviews from critics upon its release, and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://deadline.com/2024/02/mr-and-mrs-smith-premiere-amazon-ratings-record-1235820630/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Deadline</a> reported it became one of Prime Video's top five new series debuts among U.S. viewers.</p><p>Ahead of the renewal, co-creator and showrunner Sloane had made it clear that she is more than ready to work on more episodes if fans show interest through the streaming numbers.</p><p>"If the world wants a season 2, we have some really good ideas for it," Sloane told Marie Claire at the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/p/C2yveWdMECP/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Mr. and Mrs. Smith red carpet premiere</a>. "So we'll see what happens."</p><p>She played coy when asked if a second season would focus on new Smiths or if Glover and Erskine would reprise their roles. "We gotta keep it a little mysterious," she teased at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2sVVekmBg5hxAnYn3zMQp5-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=which-of-the-cast-members-will-return-for-39-mr-and-mrs-smith-39-season-2-3>Which of the cast members will return for 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' season 2?</h2><p>Though Mr. and Mrs. Smith will get a second life, Glover and Erskine's spy couple John and Jane Smith will not get the same chance. On the same day as the renewal announcement, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/mr-and-mrs-smith-renewed-season-2-amazon-donald-glover-maya-erskine-not-returning-1236001635/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Variety</a> reported that the season 1 stars are not expected to return for season 2. Prime Video declined to comment on the outlet's sourcing, but if it's true, we can only hope that the Smiths escaped the deadly shoot-out from the season 1 finale and now have to lay low in Tahiti.</p><p>The news that Glover and Erskine won't be back may not come as a total surprise for fans of the multi-hyphenate actor/writer and rapper. He recently dropped the new album Atavista under his moniker Childish Gambino and will set out on a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/donaldglover/p/C66OcTJLcc7/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>worldwide tour</a> from August 2024 through early 2025. Erskine has a busy schedule, as well. She'll soon star alongside Nicole Kidman in the upcoming HBO show <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://deadline.com/2023/01/nicole-kidman-maya-erskine-star-the-perfect-nanny-limited-series-hbo-legendary-tv-1235242302/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>The Perfect Nanny</a>, with Erskine also serving as the limited series' creator and Kidman as an executive producer.</p><h2 id=what-will-39-mr-and-mrs-smith-39-season-2-be-about-3>What will 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' season 2 be about?</h2><p>With Sloane and the rest of the Mr. and Mrs. Smith team keeping up the mystery surrounding the season 2 plot, everything at this time is just speculation.</p><p>If Glover and Erskine aren't returning for season 2, it seems likely that the series will turn into an anthology and follow a new set of Smiths. It's possible that the new couple could work under "Hi hi," or perhaps we'll finally find out who the handler is. It's also worth wondering if Moura and Posey will be back—to serve as both mentors and eventual finalizers. The show may even relocate from NYC to be set in another stunning locale. The possibilities (and dream castings for guest stars) are endless.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRoq69lo528uL%2BOpqlmmZ6Zeq6%2B0maqpqGknXq0scCspqdlYmQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./christopher-nolan-s-interstellar-adds-matt-damon-to-an-already-impressive-cast.html>&#171;&nbsp;Christopher Nolans Interstellar Adds Matt Damon To An Already Impressive Cast</a>
