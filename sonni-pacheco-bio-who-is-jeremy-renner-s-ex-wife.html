She grew up on a ranch, and animals encircled her. Consequently, this made her fond of animals. Her choice of pet is unique. Having selected frogs as her pet, unlike other children who would opt for a cat, owl or a dog, is remarkable. Besides, little is known about her background, and who her parents and siblings are.</p><p class=align-left>She finds passion in her career as a sculptor, apart from acting and modelling. Her profile on Saatchi Art partly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reads thus</a>:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a8f21eb0a7a6eb30.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Leanna Bartlett biography: age, measurements, net worth, movies</span></p></a>Pacheco truly succeeds in creating and capturing a uniquely powerful portrayal of a seemingly powerless time of her life, entrusting her audiences with her most vulnerable self. When not sculpting, Pacheco is a mother to her beautiful daughter Ava, who has made her journey nothing short of pure love.<h3>How old is Sonni Pacheco?</h3><p class=align-left>Sonni Pacheco age is 29 years as she was born in 1991. However, information about her birth date and month are not available to the public. So, no one can tell precisely when she celebrates her birthday in the year.</p><h3>What does Sonni Pacheco do for a living?</h3><p class=align-left>She is currently a realtor at KW Beverly Hills and a sculptor. Although before this time, she has ventured into several things and made a living out of them. She commenced her modelling career in Canada but moved to Mexico because she was not fulfilled and comfortable with the minor projects that she was working on. She served in a hotel resort where she was selling timeshares, upon her coming into Mexico.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/94954caa6a92f849.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting facts about Jade Tailor bio: age, height, ethnicity, movies and tv shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, she only worked for a little while before she quit. She could not proceed with the job because it was not in line with her passion. While looking out for openings that align with her interest, she moved to China, where she began to model for several media and publications. She leveraged on the opportunity and came up with a few commercials and publications at the same time.</p><p class=align-left>Interestingly, she got a big profile gig from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Monster Energy Drinks</a> where she served as their spokesperson and model. Furthermore, she branched out into the movies and had her debut in 2009. Sequel to this, she starred in several action films, including <i>Mission Impossible, Ghost Protocol </i>and <i>The Wingman.</i></p><h2>When did Jeremy Renner get divorced?</h2><p class=align-left>Jeremy Renner got divorced from his adorable wife on the 28th of December, 2015. This was four days after Pacheco had filed a divorce against him. She stated that the reason for her decision was due to irreconcilable differences, but some of their fans presumed that it was due to the vast age gap of twenty years between them. They had been barely a year in their marriage before they split.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/29061e7a8994339c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Neve Campbell bio: Interesting details about her personal and professional life</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Sonni Pacheco Jeremy Renner's love story can be traced back to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">2011</a>.

The baby girl was named Ava Berlin, and on the 13th of January, 2014, the love birds became married in an exclusive wedding ceremony.</p><h2>Jeremy Renner Sonni Pacheco daughter</h2><p class=align-left>Jeremy was very excited to announce on the media that he was a parent alongside his girlfriend. How old is Ava Berlin Renner? She is currently six years old. Although Ava parents are separated, they have combined supervision on their only child. During the process of the couple's dissolving their marriage, the court mandated Jeremy to pay <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$13,000 every month</a> child support.</p><p class=align-left>More so, five per cent of Renner's $2.3 million annual income will be included in the child backing deal. Jeremy stressed his pain about being unhappy when he does not get to see his beautiful daughter for a specific duration of time. The bond between the father and the daughter seems to be strong and healthy as she was her father's date to the Oscars award event in 2017. However, Ava lives with her mother since the separation of the parents.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/24f635254a5b125a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The chronicle of the life and career of Keri Russell</span></p></a><h2>What is Sonni Pacheco net worth?</h2><p class=align-left>According to estimations, as of 2019, Pacheco has an estimated net worth of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$2.3 million</a>.
