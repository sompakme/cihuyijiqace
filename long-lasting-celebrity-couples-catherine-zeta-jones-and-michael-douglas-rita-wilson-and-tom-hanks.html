Their relationship didn't turn romantic until 1996 after Faith ended her engagement to Scott Hendricks.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Following a whirlwind romance, which saw the 'It's Your Love' singer propose several times, the couple got married in his aunt's garden. They are now parents to three daughters, Gracie, Maggie and Audrey.</p><p dir=ltr>In a rare comment about their relationship, Faith told<a href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;People</a>: "If someone is going to judge my character because I was engaged to somebody and then I left him for somebody else – 'Oh, okay, now she’s a slut and a bad person' – I can’t control that.

They had been dating for four years after meeting in 2001 at a Rock the Vote concert.</p><p dir=ltr>"I just felt that immediate draw," Portia admitted to Oprah Winfrey, before adding: "But it took me three years to actually tell her how I felt about her because I was on Ally McBeal at the time and I was not living as an openly gay person. I was closeted and very, very afraid that if I talked about being gay, it would be the end of my career. So, I wasn't about to date the most famous lesbian in the world."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9b83385cfe90-michael-czj.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=9b83385cfe90-michael-czj>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas</h2><p dir=ltr>Aside from a brief split in 2013, Catherine Zeta-Jones and her husband Michael Douglas have been together since 1998, when they met at the Deauville Film Festival. Michael admitted he was very forward on their first date, telling the actress: "You know, I'm going to be the father of your children." And he was right!&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>They got engaged in December 1999 on a New Year's Eve trip to Aspen, and almost one year later they tied the knot at New York's Plaza Hotel. The pair are parents to children Dylan and Carys.</p><p dir=ltr>The secret to their long marriage? "It's a long road and I think people today are so quick to throw in the towel on marriage. You have to give it your best shot and not give up when the first problem arises, because that won't be the last problem," she told<a href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;Good Housekeeping</a>.

It's a big process and I guess you find yourself being more in love with these people as time goes by and here it is. We've been going out for almost two and a half years.

She told Ellen DeGeneres: "I remember thinking, I had such a crush on him, and he wasn’t interested in me. It’s true! He didn’t call me for four months."</p><p dir=ltr>During an appearance on the<a href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;Armchair Expert</a> podcast, Keith – who shares children Sunday and Faith with Nicole – gushed: "She's just the one.
