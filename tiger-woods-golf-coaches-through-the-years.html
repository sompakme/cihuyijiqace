That was his final event before a 15-month layoff for more surgery on his back. The pair stopped working together in 2017 and Woods officially announced the split in December 2017.</p><p>“Since my fusion surgery I have been working hard to relearn my own body and golf swing. I’ve done this by primarily relying on my feel and previous years of hard work with Chris. For now, I think it’s best for me to continue to do this on my own. I’m grateful to Chris Como for his past work, and I have nothing but respect for him.”</p><p>The split was very amicable, with Como telling Golf.com that he will continue to be a "close friend and resource" to Woods and that he is looking forward watching "what will be one of the most exciting sports comebacks of all time."</p><p>Como then got the job of director of instruction at the Dallas National Golf Club which is the home course of three-time major winner <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-original-url=https://www.golfmonthly.com/features/the-game/things-you-didnt-know-about-jordan-spieth-69487 data-url=https://www.golfmonthly.com/features/the-game/things-you-didnt-know-about-jordan-spieth-69487 data-before-rewrite-localise=/features/the-game/things-you-didnt-know-about-jordan-spieth-69487>Jordan Spieth</a>. He had previously worked at Gleneagles Country Club, also in Texas.</p><p>Some were critical of Como due to him being far too technical for Woods. Como has a Masters degree in Biomechanics and one anonymous caddie told the New York Daily News that he is "way worse than [Sean Foley], way too technical."</p><p>Other Tour Pros he has coached include <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/bryson-dechambeau>Bryson DeChambeau</a>, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/jason-day>Jason Day</a>, Trevor Immelman, Jamie Lovemark and Aaron Baddeley. He was reported to charge $1,500 for half-day lessons in his role at Gleneagles Country Club.</p><h2 id=sean-foley-2010-2014-3>Sean Foley: 2010 - 2014</h2><figure class="van-image-figure pull-" data-bordeaux-image-check></figure><p>Woods and Foley began working together in 2010 at the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straits. Foley has coached a number of Tour Pros including <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-original-url=https://www.golfmonthly.com/news/tour-news/things-you-didnt-know-about-justin-rose-162431 data-url=https://www.golfmonthly.com/features/the-game/things-you-didnt-know-about-justin-rose-162431 data-before-rewrite-localise=/features/the-game/things-you-didnt-know-about-justin-rose-162431>Justin Rose</a>, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-original-url=https://www.golfmonthly.com/news/tour-news/things-you-didnt-know-about-lee-westwood-162408 data-url=https://www.golfmonthly.com/features/the-game/things-you-didnt-know-about-lee-westwood-162408 data-before-rewrite-localise=/features/the-game/things-you-didnt-know-about-lee-westwood-162408>Lee Westwood</a>, Stephen Ames, Danny Willett, Sean O'Hair, Hunter Mahan and Seung-Yul Noh. Foley was credited with increasing Woods' distance as well as turning him into a fade-bias player.</p><p>Woods won nine times with Foley as his coach - once at the 2011 World Challenge plus three times in 2012 and five times in 2013, which included him returning to the world number one position. The pair split in August 2014 after Woods sustained an injury.</p><p>"With my next tournament not until my World Challenge event at Isleworth in Orlando, this is the right time to end our professional relationship," Woods said.</p><p>Foley described working with Woods as "one of the highlights of my career so far."</p><p>He said, "It was a lifelong ambition of mine to teach the best player of all time in our sport. I am both grateful of the things we had the opportunity to learn from one another, as well as the enduring friendship we have built. I have nothing but admiration and respect for him."</p><p>It was also in 2011 that Tiger started working with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/features/the-game/tiger-woods-caddie-154021>caddie Joe LaCava</a> as well, with that relationship lasting until 2023 when LaCava moved on to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/patrick-cantlay>Patrick Cantlay</a>.</p><h2 id=hank-haney-2004-2010-3>Hank Haney: 2004 - 2010</h2><figure class="van-image-figure pull-" data-bordeaux-image-check></figure><p>Hank Haney and Woods had a six year spell together which saw Tiger's swing become flatter with less wrist cock than in his Butch Harmon days. Haney is from the Dallas, Texas area and had also worked with two-time major winner Mark O'Meara.</p><p>Woods won six Majors while working with Haney, making Haney his second-most successful coach. He also won 31 PGA Tour titles in that spell. The pair parted ways as Haney officially resigned at the 2010 Players Championship.</p><p>He then infamously released a tell-all book titled 'The Big Miss: My Years Coaching Tiger Woods' and was criticized by some for releasing confidential information that went against the player-coach code.</p><h2 id=butch-harmon-1993-2004-3>Butch Harmon: 1993 - 2004</h2><figure class="van-image-figure pull-" data-bordeaux-image-check></figure><p>Butch Harmon is largely considered as one of the very best golf coaches of his era, and was with Woods for 11 years. Butch is a former pro and son of the 1948 Masters winner Claude Harmon Sr. His son Claude is also a successful instructor.</p><p>Woods had his best results under Butch Harmon, winning three US Amateur titles in a row and then eight Majors as a pro, which included the Tiger Slam in 2000 and 2001 where he owned all four Major trophies simultaneously. He also won 34 PGA Tour titles under Harmon.</p><p>Harmon has taught the likes of Ernie Els, Fred Couples, Davis Love III, Greg Norman, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/phil-mickelson>Phil Mickelson</a>, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/dustin-johnson>Dustin Johnson</a> and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/rickie-fowler>Rickie</a> Fowler.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLvLn6SopqSdubp6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZq2glWK0ornEaK6hp12YvKKvx56qZqyZnLKzedaopp2rXWaDc3yUbA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./why-did-john-cena-wear-a-skirt-and-heels-the-real-reason-behind-cross-dressing.html>&#171;&nbsp;Why did John Cena wear a skirt and heels?
