gorgeous, respectively, but their choice to end the maintenance of dyeing their hair marks a shift in the haircare space. While millennials have long been the ideal customer for virtually every haircare brand that has launched in recent years, brands like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Better Not Younger</a> are leading the age-positive hair movement, with products and formulas that cater to the haircare needs of women over 40.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Founded by beauty industry veteran Sonsoles Gonzalez, Better Not Younger's products are designed to enhance thinning, dry hair, while simultaneously balancing the scalp to improve the quality of hair growth. A few standouts from the line include a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>multitasking hair and scalp serum</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>purple shampoo for gray and white hair</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>thickening spray</a> that's both a treatment and styling product.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For me, hair improvement starts with your scalp. I'll never promise to make you grow your hair back, but I do promise that your hair will grow better, and you may slow down the shedding — and that's a real need in the marketplace." Gonzalez says of Better Not Younger's products.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, Gonzalez shares how outdated beauty industry standards inspired her brand, the biggest misconception women have about aging hair, and more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How did your personal experience in the beauty industry inspire you to start Better Not Younger?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I worked in big corporations for many years at Procter & Gamble and L'Oréal. I was always so surprised at how the industry is so focused on the younger population and all the products and marketing briefs were geared to women aged 18 to 44. I always joked about what happens to women after that. Like do they just disappear at 45? Fast forward a few years when I left the corporate world and decided I was going to start my own company. I immediately thought about my insight into industry, and the fact that it has been so focused on millennials and youthfulness as the only standard of beauty. I was seeing how my own body, skin and hair were changing, and thought there has to be a better solution. And that's how Better Not Younger came to be.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>In recent years, a number of age-positive skincare brands have launched. Why do you think haircare is lagging?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Traditionally, the industry has always focused on covering grays. However, 100% of women will tell you their hair has changed and doesn't feel the same as they've gotten older and they don't understand why. I think haircare has lagged is because there's not an understanding of what's going on with hair in general. Also, companies have been so focused on the most visible signs aging like wrinkles, dryness, and gray hair that they haven't fully thought through what else could be effecting the hair beyond the grays.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Did you experience any roadblocks because you wanted to launch a brand that doesn't cater to millennials?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There were roadblocks on so many levels. On one side, people were saying the brand is just a marketing gimmick because there's no science behind the ingredients in the products, which is wrong. We're starting to get more and more consumer data and clinical studies to prove it. The second issue was the media. We would pitch the brand to magazines and they would say they couldn't talk to old women in their publications because it would turn off the younger reader. I would think to myself, if anything, the older population is who still reads physical magazines. I think that conversation is starting to change. We started this brand two and a half years ago, and during this time we've seen a number of brands come out and talk about menopause.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception about aging hair?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The biggest misconception is that people see a change in their hair, but they don't think it's reversible. It's very sudden, whereas I think our skin changes are a little more subtle. You start seeing changes around your eyes and then frown lines. With hair, you start getting a few grays, and then three years will go by, and boom: you have a ton of gray hair. When perimenopause and menopause hits, the drop in estrogen can cause so many changes like thinning hair, dry hair, and shedding. People believe they can't do anything about it, but you can. You can start taking preventative measures earlier, maybe in your 30s, so you won't go through such drastic changes. Hair loss is one area in particular that people think you can't treat. It's really hard to grow hair back, but that doesn't mean you can't help prevent hair loss and help the quality of your hair growth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: This Haircutting Technique Adds Crazy Volume — and Requires No Scissors</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shop-better-not-younger-products></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Shop Better Not Younger Products</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Superpower Fortifying Hair & Scalp Serum</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Packed with skincare-favorite and plant-based ingredients, Better Not Younger's lightweight serum helps to nourish, soothe, and stimulate the scalp to create the optimal environment for hair growth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$47; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>sephora.com</a></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>License to Curl Curl Revival Boost Spray</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This convenient spray helps rehydrate and reshape curls in-between washes.
